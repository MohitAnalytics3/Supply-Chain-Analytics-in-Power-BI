Supply Chain Analytics in Power BI

This repository contains my project work from the "Case Study: Supply Chain Analytics in Power BI" course on DataCamp. The project focuses on analyzing supply chain data to make informed decisions regarding the make or buy options.
Introduction

The project aims to leverage Power BI for effective supply chain decision-making. It involves analyzing supplier quotes, assessing internal manufacturing costs, and performing scenario analysis to recommend optimal strategies.
