# Supply-Chain-Analytics-in-Power-BI
This repository showcases my project from the "Case Study: Supply Chain Analytics in Power BI" course on DataCamp. The project involves analyzing supply chain data to make strategic decisions regarding the make or buy options.

# Project Overview
# The Buy Option

    Analyzed supplier quotes to calculate extended and full costs.
    Visualized the lowest cost suppliers using Power BI dashboards.

# The Make Option

    Assessed internal manufacturing costs and capacity requirements.
    Evaluated the cost of quality and its impact on decision-making.

# Scenario Analysis

    Developed a tool to examine cost changes with varying production volumes.
    Recommended optimal order volumes based on cost analysis.

# Skills Demonstrated

    Power BI data modeling and visualization
    DAX functions for cost calculations
    Scenario analysis in supply chain management

# Files Included

    Power BI files (.pbix)
    Datasets for analysis
    Documentation and visualizations
